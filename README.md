Date: July 24, 2025

🎯 Project Objective
This project explores how Netflix content emotionally or motivationally impacts viewers using a dataset designed for analytical and educational purposes. Using Python and Pandas, we clean, analyze, and visualize data to extract meaningful insights about genres, ratings, discovery methods, and viewer takeaways.

📊 Dataset Overview
The Netflix Life Impact Dataset (NLID) contains viewer insights on:

Movie Title, Genre, Release Year

Average Ratings and Number of Reviews

Life-Changing Moments (timestamps)

Discovery Source (e.g., Friends, Social Media)

Advice Taken

Recommendation Rate

⚠️ Note: This dataset is manually curated from viewer responses and public sources and is not an official Netflix release.

🧹 Data Cleaning Process
We performed several preprocessing steps before analysis:

Parsed non-numeric values (e.g., percentages, time strings)

Split combined fields like genres and keywords

Standardized inconsistent labels (e.g., discovery methods)

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📈 Visual Insights
This project includes 12+ key visualizations:

Word Cloud of Meaningful Advice

💡 Key Findings
Genres like Drama, Documentary, and Sci-Fi are more likely to create lasting impact.

Viewers mostly discover life-changing movies through friends or social media.

Core life lessons include persistence, kindness, courage, and self-awareness.

Personal recommendations play a powerful role in emotional storytelling.
